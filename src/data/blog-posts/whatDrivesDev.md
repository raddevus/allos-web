#### Here's My Theory On What Drives Dev
1. **Curiosity** (You wonder why a thing is the way it is or want to know how something works.)
2. **Spark of Belief** (generates enough energy that you actually begin the tackle the problem) 
3. **Tenacity** (ability to fail your way to the solution)
Or, as famous quote says, 
>"Success is the ability to move from one failure to another without loss of enthusiasm."
4. **Iteration** -- as you work through the problem you see hints of other things that make you 1. **Curious** and you begin to better understand the problem driving your 2. **Belief** that you can solve it.  You stumble upon other problems but your 3. **Tenacity** kicks in and you push forward.  

And, so it goes.

#### Consider The Opposite
1. If you aren't **Curious** about how things work, you will never begin to even think of actually trying to build a solution.  You will sit in the "I don't know what to do." bog.
2. Even if you're Curious, if you never obtain the **Spark of Belief** that you could actually create the solution, you will not even begin to type.  
> "The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right." ~Confucious
3. If, every time you meet resistance you quit (no **Tenacity**) you will never be able to achieve the good feelings of success.
4. If any of those cause you to never try or to quit early, you will never **Iterate** and nothing will ever happen.

#### Think About People You've Worked With
I've worked with a particular dev who just waits for someone to tell him to do something: no Curiosity.  

I've asked him, "Hey, why haven't we improved the bad production code that causes this issue?"
His answer: "I don't know.  It works good enough, I guess."

Same dev goes to Design something & presents it.
You ask one question and it pokes a hole in the entire design.
He says, "I hadn't thought of that.  I don't know how that works."
Totally disinterested.  Zero curiosity! 

What do you think?
