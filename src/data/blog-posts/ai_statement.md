## Official Statement & Stance On AI

Because of the way the world is now and because you may wonder about the use of AI on this site and in my books, I think it's important to make an official statement about my use of AI.

1. None of this site or my books have been written by AI.<br>
2. I wrote every word that you read on this site and in my books.<br>
3. I do use AI, but I use it like a search engine, not as a replacement for my brain.
4. I also verify that the things AI tells me are correct, because (as I'm sure you know) it often hallucinates (makes things up).
5. AI writing is bland and boring. It has no gut. AI has no feelings and doesn't understand what it means to have feelings and that blandness comes through when it communicates.

Imagine ideas as all the food of the world thrown into a giant blender and whipped until it's a juice.  Imagine drinking that mess.  You may imagine it tastes like everything but in reality It would taste like nothing.  That's what AI writing is like.

## Writing For Humans, By A Human
I'm a human and I wrote the articles on this site and my book's for myself and for others who still want to think for themselves and connect as humans.
