	Just created this web site as a place to reference links which 
	will be mentioned on the upcoming podcast.<br>
	
	Episode 1 intro - all about cross-platform dev but more than that, making deployment easy,
No friction for user - just grab &amp; go
The driving factor is making it so easy to try my apps that the user has no second thoughts about it -
Lowest bar possible —&gt;
First I just want a lot of people to use my apps.
Example app: DiscoProcs
How can I get you to try it?
Maybe you are listening to this podcast &amp; wondering why since you aren’t convinced that cross-platform is that important - I think you’ll still find a lot here bec my main focus is “getting apps into hands of users”
And that means deployment, packaging , distribution etc
It’s difficult to find great info about this anywhere and I hope to solve that with this podcast &amp; associated web site (for links)
